                    Every athlete knows the absolute willingness to question everything is crucial to achieving a top performance. With this attitude, Porsche continues to push back the boundaries of what is possible. <br>
                    Wet asphalt, tight corner combinations, personal driving style: there are many factors to consider in motorsport for an optimal setup. That's why the steering wheel with three additional mode switches offers even more options for adapting chassis control systems to the actual driving conditions.

                Porsche 911 GT3 RS is the top model in the 911 lineup and the price of 911 top model is Rs. 3.51 Crore. Porsche 911 GT3 RS is available in Automatic (DCT) transmission and offered in 4 colours: White, Black, Racing Yellow and Guards Red.<br>
                Naturally aspirated flat-six delivers near spiritual levels of sound and thrust, razor-sharp moves with the grip to match, functional yet comfortable cabin. <br>
                The GT3 and GT3 RS deliver the type of unfiltered performance and precision typically reserved for purebred race vehicles, and we love them for that.

                   Mild suspension geometry tweaks and components have trickled down to the GT3s from the RS, and both cars, regardless of transmission, get a shorter final drive ratio for quicker starts. A Weissach Package is available for the GT3 that features extensive use of CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic) for the roof and aero elements as well as specific suspension components. Leather and Race-Tex upholstery touches augment the interior. <br>
                   The GT3 Touring offers the Lightweight (Leichtbau) Package with similar CFRP suspension bits, forged magnesium wheels, and a lightweight battery. Finally, rear seats, unavailable in the previous year, return to the option list on the GT3 touring.

            <p>The BMW E30 is the popular, second-generation 3 Series, produced from 1982 to 1994,
               known for its balanced design, engaging driving dynamics, and strong engineering, which includes four-door saloons, coupes, convertibles, and wagons, and is considered a classic that helped define the "ultimate driving machine" reputation for BMW.

        <p>The E30 is widely regarded as a classic car and helped solidify the 3 Series' reputation as a stylish, practical, and fun compact sports saloon. 
             Its powerful engines and handling capabilities were also key to BMW's success in various forms of motor sport, including DTM and rallying. 
             The driver-angled dashboard and short-throw, firm gear shift emphasize the driver-focused nature of the E30.

                All E30s came with front disc brakes and the same basic suspension setup, but the 316 and 318 entry level cars all had fairly lethargic ‘M10’ four-cylinder engines with a single overhead cam.
                 The engines’ roots could be traced back to the early 1960s, and you could feel it. It was the six-cylinder cars that impressed the most at launch, with 2.0 and 2.3-litre ‘M20’ 
                 engines that felt much more alive and gave the small BMW some proper sporty credentials.
